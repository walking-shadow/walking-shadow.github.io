  This research introduces VegeDiff to forecast future vegetation states by employing a novel diffusion model to probabilistically capture uncertainties in vegetation change. It accurately models dynamic meteorological and static environmental impacts, providing clear, precise predictions, outperforming existing deterministic methods.
